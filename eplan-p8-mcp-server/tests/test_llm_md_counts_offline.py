"""
Pins the tool count that llm.md advertises against what the server publishes.

llm.md tells the model "It exposes **199 tools**". That number is correct today
(verified: build_app(mode="full") publishes exactly 199), so this is not a rot
fix - it is a rot *guard*. The count is hand-written prose about a number the
code owns, which is precisely the shape that goes stale silently: add a wrapper
and llm.md is wrong, with nothing to say so.

Offline: builds the app without connecting to EPLAN.
