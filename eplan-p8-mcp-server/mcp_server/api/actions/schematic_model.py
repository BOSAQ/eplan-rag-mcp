"""
Pure helpers for the schematic primitives - no EPLAN, no pythonnet, no I/O.

Everything here is testable with EPLAN closed, which matters because the script
engine gives no compiler output: a C# compile error writes no result file and
reaches the caller as an indistinguishable "timeout". So as much logic as
possible lives on this side of the boundary, where a test can simply call it.

Two jobs:

1. THE INJECTION BOUNDARY. Every caller value that reaches generated C# goes
   through cs_double / cs_int / cs_text here. Numbers are interpolated OUTSIDE
   any string literal - they are code - so a non-number must be refused rather
   than escaped. Text goes inside a literal and is escaped, and additionally may
   not contain the {{RESULT_PATH}} token, because _execute_script replaces that
   token blindly across the whole script text.

2. GEOMETRY THE MODEL SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO. Grid snapping, deciding whether a
   pin coordinate is relative or absolute, whether two pins coincide, and
   whether two points share an axis (an unrouted connection line can only be
   drawn between points that do).
