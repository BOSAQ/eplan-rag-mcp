"""
Graphical-editor (GED) interaction-start actions.

Every action here STARTS AN INTERACTIVE PLACEMENT in EPLAN's graphical editor:
it puts the GED into a mode that would normally be completed by a human
clicking in the drawing area.

MEASURED BEHAVIOUR (EPLAN 2027.0.1 Premium, scratch project, 2026-09-02) -
all four actions here were run live under QuietModes.ShowNoDialogs:
  - Each returned IMMEDIATELY. None blocked the caller.
  - A dismiss watch armed across all four recorded ZERO modal dialogs, so in
    practice these do not raise a blocking prompt.
  - start_ged_interaction returns success=False when no page is open in the
    editor, and success=True once one is. Open a page first (edit_open_page).
  - insert_device opens the configured parts database READ-ONLY to resolve the
    part number.

So these are safe to call unattended, with one caveat worth keeping in mind:
the call returning does not mean the interaction FINISHED - it means the
interaction was STARTED, and EPLAN is left in that mode. QuietMode suppresses
modal *dialogs*; it does not itself cancel a placement waiting for a click.
The two are different mechanisms, so a future EPLAN build or an interaction
name not covered above could still leave the editor parked in a mode.

Recommended when calling these in an unattended loop:
  1. Arm a UI dismiss watcher (a background watcher that clicks Cancel/OK
     on any window that appears) as cheap insurance - it costs nothing
     and turns a surprise modal into evidence instead of a hang.
  2. Check eplan_get_system_messages afterwards - a hung EPLAN call is almost
     always a live interaction or a modal left on screen.

    The official docs document only the "Name" parameter and give no list of
    valid interaction names. The names below were mined from the live install's
    GUI action map (Cfg/MFTools.xml) and are grouped by the entry-point action
    that actually dispatches them - passing a 2D/3D/comment name to this base
    action will not work.

    Names dispatched by THIS action (XGedStartInteractionAction):
        XMIaInsertMacro                  - insert a window/symbol macro
                                           (takes /filename and /variant)
        XMIaSetMacroBoxInsertionPoint    - set macro box insertion point
        XGedIaCenterViewPlacement        - center a view placement
        XGedIaFormatText                 - format text properties
